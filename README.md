# ITRECHNER

This is a program to calculate tolerance minimum and maximum dimension technical fit for
shaft and bore according DIN ISO 286-1 and DIN ISO 286-2. Given by nominal dimensions, 
and tolerace grade, tolerance class.

Written to simplify the work of metalworkers, lathe operators and other cutting machine
operators.
Works from 3mm up to 3150 mm
Tolerancelasses:
shaft:
a, b, c, cd, e, ef, f, fg, g, h, js, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, x, y, z, za, zb, zc,
bore:
A, B, C, CD, E, EF, F, FG, G, H, JS, J, K, M, N, P, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, ZA, ZB, ZC

From IT 9 up IT 13 nominal dimensions for greater 3 mm up to 500 mm

Tolerancelasses cd, CD, ef,EF,fg, FG, j,J,k,K 
greater 3 mm up to 500 mm

This tolerance grades are included:
01, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 up to 18


Tolerance classes for screw threads
outside thread:
g,a,b,c,d,e,f,h
inside thread:
G,H

Tolerance grades for screw thread:
01,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

Included
Screw pitch in mm per thread:
1.5, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6,0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 1, 1.25, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 0.3, 4, 5, 5.5, 8

Calculates the limits for
